# Constraints

One cultural constraint for our project would be the language used. Translations and support for multiple languages would be a great addition to our idea but would likely take too much time to implement. This means that non-English speakers would be unable to use our application. It also means that our search results may be biased towards English sources online. Another constant we have are legalities with web scraping. In the United States, web scraping is legal as long as the data is publicly available and no harm is done to the original website. However, we must be careful that no intellectual property or confidential data is being scraped.
