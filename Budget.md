As of 11/26, there have been no necessary expenses for our project.

Estimating the cost of the project for the fall semester:
- 45 hours of work per team member
- Estimated wage: $30/hour (based on national average for computer science graduates)

The total would be 45 * 30 = $1,350 per team member for the fall semester.
$1,350 * 3 = $4,050 for the entire project.
