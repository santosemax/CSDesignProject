Semester 1 Appendix:
Each team member met at least once per week on Wednesdays and/or Fridays (per our team contract) to work on assignments.

Over the course of the semester, 2 hours per week * 10 assignments = ~20 hours.

Along with that, team members also worked individually on their assignments from our effort matrix, usually around 2 hours per week at a minimum.

2 hours per week * 14 weeks = ~28 hours.

This means that each team member put in around 48 hours of work for the semester.
