# Background Description:
An application that pulls from the web articles done on films, literature, or any other forms of art that you may be interested in. This would include providing a user with facts about a writer, a director, or any other artist/scientist you may be interested in. I'm interested in this because Google is often bloated and having something more streamlined could be something more practical.

# Problem Statement

# Topic Area
- Frontend and Backend Development using Python, SQL, and frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React.
