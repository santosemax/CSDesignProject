# Background Description:
Submarine is an application that pulls from the web articles done on films, literature, or any other forms of art that you may be interested in. This would include providing a user with facts about a writer, a director, or any other artist you may be interested in. 

# Problem Statement
We are interested in this because when searching for information regarding art, Google is often bloated and having something more streamlined could be something more practical for those looking to expand their knowledge on in their desired subject.

# Topic Area
- Frontend and Backend Development using Python, SQL, Flask and frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript.
