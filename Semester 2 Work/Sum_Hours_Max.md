### Summary of Hours (Max):
- I was capable of completing all of my tasks that were dedicated to me through our groups [timeline/effort_matrix](https://github.com/santosemax/CSDesignProject/blob/main/Assignment6/tables.md). I also accomplished a lot more than this.

- I worked on and off this semester, mostly on weekends. If we had an assignment that week I would complete that during the week. When recording my hours, I received the following:
- Every weekend I spent about 1-2 hours a day. For both semesters cummulatively, this would be 1.5 * 2 = 3 hours per weekend; multipied by 14 (14 weeks in the semester excluding last one) = 42; then, lastly, multiplying this by two (two semesters), I have 84 hours total over the two semester just on the coding portion alone.
    - Note: For last semester, I had two hours per week instead of weekend which ends up with the same calculation.
- In addition to the coding, I had the assignments which also add to this number.

- I would also like to insert my commits on Github:

- Note: I did not commit every weekend.
