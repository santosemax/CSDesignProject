# TeamMSJ Project

### Goal Statement: 
We are striving to provide a service which will provide users with clean, streamlined results for people, projects, and works within the domain of art and science. The square boxes are the ordinary steps our application will take regardless of what the user is doing at the moment. The diamonds are conditional statements which rely on the users input to move to the next step. The circles are the start and end points of our application. The lines represent what must happen in between each step. Most of these are just direct connections but if there is text, then they will only happen if the user inputs the respective input.
