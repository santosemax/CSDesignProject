# Constraints

One cultural constraint for our project would be the language used. Translations and support for multiple languages would be a great addition to our idea but would likely take too much time to implement. This means that non-English speakers would be unable to use our application. It also means that our search results may be biased towards English sources online. Another constant we have are legalities with web scraping. In the United States, web scraping is legal as long as the data is publicly available and no harm is done to the original website. However, we must be careful that no intellectual property or confidential data is being scraped. An ethical constraint worth considering is that the results returned don't disparage any minority group. As we streamline search results for people, projects, and works within the domain of art and science if we make it easier for people to ignore results about a targeting minority group this could severely impact the livelihood of said people. A possible solution for this issue could be a blacklist of terms that results can't be filtered by to ensure all groups of people have the possibility of being seen.
